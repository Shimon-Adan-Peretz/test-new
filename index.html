								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Crypto Cube started with a mission statement, “Simplify Crypto trading for the modern Market.”
									Our team of programmers and financiers worked hand in hand to bring a level of trust and transparency to Crypto Asset management that is 
									unparalleled in the current market. Using the world’s most powerful summarization software, the Crypto Cube Autotrader is the first A.I 
									trading software to fully utilize machine learning and direct access to Market API to maximize investment potential.</p>

									<h4>Ali Alsari/Founder</h4>
									<h3>A Message From Our Founder</h3>
									<p>Our Founder Ali Alsari established Crypto Cube due to an intense dissatisfaction with the business models currently practiced by the major central banks,
										and traditional Wall Street Firms, riddled with conflicts, and built upon
										contradictory and competing interests.
										Built on the philosophy of employing an open architecture of the best Money managers we do not sell any proprietary funds or loose investments.
										Crypto Cube’s vision is pivoted on a simple premise, financial advise should not be influenced by incentive to sell products. We manage and advise, we don’t sell.
										Our business practices are rooted in our belief that we must always act in our clients’ best interest and must adhere to the highest ethical, moral and fiduciary
										responsibility, without exception.</p>
